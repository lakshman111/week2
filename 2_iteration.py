# Let's learn about lists and iteration so we can automate things.

# print(10)
# print(11)
# print(12)
# print(13)
# print(14)


# 1. Let's use a "while" loop to print the integers from 10 to 14.
# n = 9
# while (n < 15):
#   n = n + 1
#   print(n)






# 2. Let's use a "for" loop combined with a list to print the integers from 1 to 5.
# numbers = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]

# for i in numbers:
#   print(i)

# What he did:
# numbers = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
# position = 0
# while (position < 5):
#     print(numbers[position])
#     position = position + 1



# 3. Use a "for" loop combined with a range to print the integers from 10 to 14.
# for i in range(10,15):
#   print(i)
