# Let's learn about lists and iteration so we can automate things.

print(10)
print(11)
print(12)
print(13)
print(14)


# 1. Let's use a "while" loop to print the integers from 10 to 14.




# 2. Let's use a "for" loop combined with a list to print the integers from 1 to 5.
numbers = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]



# 3. Use a "for" loop combined with a range to print the integers from 10 to 14.
