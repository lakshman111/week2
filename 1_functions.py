# Let's learn about functions, the DRY principle,
# function arguments/parameters, and scope.

# DEMO:

print("Hello, Jeff")
print("Nice to meet you.")




# 1. CHALLENGE: How would you write a function to help
#    simplify the following code?
#
# print("Chicago Landmarks")
# print("-----------------")
# print("Wrigley Field costs about $40 and is located at 1033 W. Addison St.")
# print("The Bean costs $0 and is located at Millenium Park.")
# print("The John Hancock Tower costs about $35 and is located at 1875 N. Michigan Ave.")
# print("The United Center costs about $75 and is located at 11901 W. Madison St.")
# print("The Shakespeare Theater costs about $40 and is located at 1Navy Pier")
